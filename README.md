This is a work in progress
-------
JVerify
=======

An application to create MD5 and SHA-1/256/512 hashes and check for file integrity.

Simplicity
-------
The purpose of this tool is to create an interface in wich you can easily create hashes and check for file integrity.
I try to accomplish this by using a drag and drop interface (Wich is also click-able) in wich you can easily drop multiple files at once.

Foldertracking
-------

The main power of this tool is the ability to track file changes and MD5/Sha-sums inside of specified folders. Everytime you add something to the folder, the application will update the MD5's or SHA's in regular intervals and add it to a manifest. Leaving you with nothing to worry about.

Future plans
-------

Future plans are to create automated Chain of Evidence tracking (some more advanced file tracking ).
